**What is FirebaseAuthSample**

I was coding a separate cross-platform app and run into a need of authentication method for it. It was frustrating to see that there were very few options for .NET MAUI available but I decided to go with Firebase authentication as I have used before with Android development.
There is a limited number of Firebase Auth packages available in NuGet but I decided to use FirebaseAuthentication.net from Step Up Labs. https://github.com/step-up-labs/firebase-authentication-dotnet.
FirebaseAuthentication.net has provided some sample code in their github, but alas, there is no sample code for .NET MAUI.

**Applications etc. needed**

- Visual Studio 2022
 
**Step by step instructions for trying it out**

- Clone the repository https://github.com/seppomoj/FirebaseAuthSample/
- Install Firebaseauthentication.net package with Nuget Package manager. (Tools - Nuget Package manager - Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...)
  - Check box next to Project and click Install
-
