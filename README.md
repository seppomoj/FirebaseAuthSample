1. What is FirebaseAuthSample
I was coding a separate app and run into a need of authentication method. It was frustrating to see that there were very few options for .NET MAUI available but I decided to go with Firebase authentication as I have used before with Android development.
There is a limited number of Firebase Auth packages available in NuGet but I decided to use FirebaseAuthentication.net from Step Up Labs. https://github.com/step-up-labs/firebase-authentication-dotnet.
FirebaseAuthentication.net has provided some sample code in their github, but alas, there is no sample code for .NET MAUI.
